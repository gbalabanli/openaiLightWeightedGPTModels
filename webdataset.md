How to download and use üç∑ FineWeb
You can load the full dataset or a specific crawl/dump (see table below). Dumps have the format CC-MAIN-(year)-(week number).

(Smaller) sample versions
Along with config default (all the data), and the configs for each individual dump, you can also download the following configs:

sample-350BT: a subset randomly sampled from the whole dataset of around 350B gpt2 tokens (388GB)
sample-100BT: a subset randomly sampled from the whole dataset of around 100B gpt2 tokens (277.4GB)
sample-10BT: a subset randomly sampled from the whole dataset of around 10B gpt2 tokens (27.6GB)
sample-10B was sampled from sample-100B which in turn was sampled from sample-350BT.
